# How to contribute

CoreOS projects are Apache 2.0 licensed and accept contributions via Github
pull requests.  This document outlines some of the conventions on commit
message formatting, contact points for developers and other resources to make
getting your contribution accepted.

# Certificate of Origin

    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the README.md for build instructions

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format, see below
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request

Thanks for you contributions!

### Format of the commit message

We follow a rough convention for commit messages borrowed from Angularjs. This
is an example of a commit:

```
    feat(scripts/test-cluster): add a cluster test command

    this uses tmux to setup a test cluster that you can easily kill and
    start for debugging.
```

To make it more formal it looks something like this:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The first line is the subject and should not be longer than 70 characters, the
second line is always blank and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.
This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various
git tools.

### Subject line

The subject line contains succinct description of the change.

### Allowed <type>
- feat (feature)
- fix (bug fix)
- docs (documentation)
- style (formatting, missing semi colons, â€¦)
- refactor
- test (when adding missing tests)
- chore (maintain)

### Allowed <scope>

Scopes could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example store, api, etc.

guide](https://docs.google.com/a/coreos.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#).
